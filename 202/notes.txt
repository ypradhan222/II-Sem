Storage layer -
Metadata layer -
Cache layer - Has data which is required again and again
FE layer :
   stateless -
   Stateful -
what will make front end stateless?
In what layer will load balancer be?

Netflix like system:
1. Processing queue
2. Encoder 
   Converting the video format
3. Thumbnail Generator
   They can stored in cache layer so that they are fast. 
4. User Information data
5. Video metadata Storage

Questions to be asked for detailed design??
1. Is system going to read heavy or write heavy or both?
2. Should we design a system that can retrive videos quickly?
3. Read -write ratio
4,5,6,7,8,9.....

How will the layers can if they are both write heavy or read heavy?
-> have two front ends
-> 

Data Sharding
